               <h1>Porsche Boxster G3: 5/10</h1>
               <p>      <b>Reliability:</b> 3/10 - This car is a poor quality Porsche as it is a very basic cheap entry level Porsche with nothing going for it. Also, suprisngly the build quality of this car is rather poor and shotty over a number of Boxter owners.
               <br><br> <b>Safety:</b> 7/10 - This car as a Porsche comes with various safety features that add to the overall safety of the car. These include ESC, ABS, TCS ect. However, there is a fault with the seatbelts that if the mounting holes in the seat belt anchor plates are fitted too small the risk of injury during a crash is increased. This is because of seat belt loosing or not being routted properly around the passenger.
               <br><br> <b>Performance:</b> 7/10 - This car goes from 0-100 in 4.7 seconds with a top speed of 288km/h. This car also has a flat-four engine and has most commonly a RWD system. Lastly, this car has a dual-clutch automatic gearbox which provides smooth gear changes expected in a Porsche. 
               <br><br> <b>Practicality:</b> 3/10 - Although this car so has some reputation to it this car is completly unpractical. First off, the resale for the car is be horrendous as it is unpopular and widely disliked. Secondly, this car's space is very limited with only 2 seats which is not practical for everyday use. 
               <br><br> <b>Price:</b> 5/10 - This car although relativley cheap for a Porsche (25,000-45,000) is a very bad car in price terms to buy as it depreciates and is an entry level Porsche so is commonly unwanted amongst Porsche owners.
